# Mapping Earthquakes

# Overview

For this project we utilized GeoJSON earthquake data to create interactive maps with Leaflet.

There are three separate overlays that can be selected:
- All earthquakes that that were recorded over the past seven days
- Recorded earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 from the paast seven days
- Tectonic plate boundaries

# Result

The maps can be found here: https://brianbutler08.github.io/Mapping_Earthquakes2

The menu in the upper right can be used to select the base map in addition to any layer(s).
